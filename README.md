# Piscine_Rush_00

• Files to submit: main.c, ft_putchar.c and your rush0X.c, ’0X’ represents the
rush number. For example rush00.c.

• Those three files will be compiled together.

• Your file ft_putchar.c should include the function ft_putchar.

• You must therefore write the function rush taking two variables of type int as
arguments, named respectively x and y. No need to say this function should be on
the rush0X.c file.

• Your function rush should display (on-screen) a rectangle of x characters for width,
and y characters for length.

• Your function should never crash or loop indefinitely.

• Your main will be modified during defense, to check if you’ve handled everything
